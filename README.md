The [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org) cookbook: delicious and nutritious bioinformatics recipes
=================================================================================================

This series of IPython Notebooks contains executable "recipes" for bioinformatics workflows using [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org).

Disclaimer: **This is not the main scikit-bio documentation.** You can find the latest scikit-bio API documentation [here](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/latest/). **This is an experimental project**, and while we'll make an effort to keep these notebooks up-to-date, at this point we are not guaranteeing that they will work. If these notebooks seem to be useful, we'll hook up automated testing to ensure that they work.
