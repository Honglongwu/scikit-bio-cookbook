The [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org) cookbook: delicious and nutritious bioinformatics recipes
=================================================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biocore/scikit-bio-cookbook.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biocore/scikit-bio-cookbook)

This series of IPython Notebooks contains executable "recipes" for bioinformatics workflows using [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org).

Disclaimer: **This is not the main scikit-bio documentation.** You can find the latest scikit-bio API documentation [here](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/latest/). These notebooks are only tested to work with the latest scikit-bio release. They may not work with older versions of scikit-bio.

To view a static version of the cookbook, [start here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biocore/scikit-bio-cookbook/blob/master/Index.ipynb).

Installation
------------

To view and interact with the notebooks, you'll need the latest scikit-bio release and IPython installed. The easiest way to install these dependencies is:

    pip install numpy
    pip install scikit-bio IPython[all]

Next, assuming you are in the ``scikit-bio-cookbook`` directory, run:

    ipython notebook
